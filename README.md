### Project Overview

 This data analysis project aims to provide valuable insights into the sales performance of Global Superstore. By analysing various aspects of the sales data, we seek to:
Track gross sales, net sales, and profit for both the previous and current years.
Identify sales and profit trends over the years.
Determine high-performing countries in terms of sales and profit, as well as underperforming regions that require strategic focus for improvement.
Highlight key areas of excellence within the business.
Pinpoint aspects that need improvement to drive future sales and profit growth.
Through this analysis, we aim to support data-driven decision-making, enabling the business to optimize its strategies and enhance long-term profitability.

### Data Source

The dataset used for this project is the "Global_Superstore.csv" file. It contains detailed information on each sale made by the company, including order details, customer demographics, product categories, and financial metrics such as sales, profit, and discounts.

- Charts & Visualizations – Created graphical representations of sales performance, trends, and key insights for better interpretation.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) focused on uncovering key insights from the sales data by addressing the following critical questions:
-	How have gross sales, and profit evolved over the previous and current years?
-	What are the key trends in sales and profit over the years?
-	Which are the top 10 countries in terms of sales and profit, and how can underperforming countries be strategically improved?
-	Which areas of the business are excelling, and which aspects require improvement?
-	How have additional charges based on shipping mode impacted net sales and overall profitability over the years?
  Addtional Charges on Shipping modes:
  1. 	Economy	1%
  2. 	Economy Plus 2%
  3. Immediate	3%
  4. Priority	5%

### Findings/Results
- There has been a 32% increase in gross sales from the previous year to the current year.
- There has also been a 22% increase in profit from the previous year to the current year.
- The company’s sales and profit trends are impressive, with significant month-over-month increases and a notable rise from the previous year to the current year.
- Among our top 10 performing countries in terms of sales, the company has seen impressive sales growth over the year. However, Austria and the Netherlands, both of which are among the top 10, require attention as their sales have declined by 26.6% and 2.3%, respectively, from the previous year to the current year.
- Among our top 10 performing countries in terms of profits, the company has seen strong profit growth over the year. However, France, Austria, and Italy, which are also among the top 10, require attention as their profits have declined by 3.7% and 34.4%, respectively. Italy is particularly concerning, with a drastic decline of 201.9% from the previous year to the current year.
- The company's segments are performing well, with the consumer segment being the most profitable in terms of gross sales and profit. However, while the other segments are also showing strong performance, the corporate segment experienced a decline in gross sales, which the company needs to address. Nonetheless, its profit remained strong in the current year.
- All regions showed positive growth in both sales and profit. Most importantly, after accounting for additional charges, there were impressive improvements in sales and profit over the years.
- Net profit, after accounting for additional charges, also showed a 33% increase from the previous year to the current year.

### Recommendations
- Maintain the successful sales and marketing strategies that contributed to the 32% increase in gross sales and the 22% rise in profit.
- Explore opportunities to further optimize pricing, promotions, and customer engagement to sustain this positive trend.
- The company needs to conduct a detailed market analysis to identify the key factors contributing to the sales decline in Austria (-26.6%) and the Netherlands (-2.3%). This analysis should include customer feedback, competitive landscape evaluation, pricing strategies, and potential economic or industry-specific challenges affecting these markets.
- Analyse the underlying factors contributing to profit declines in France (-3.7%), Austria (-34.4%), and Italy (-201.9%).
- Identify factors contributing to the decline in gross sales within the corporate segment while leveraging the strong profit performance.
